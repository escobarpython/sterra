      <span class="highlight" style="--d:0s;">STERRA</span> is a living space where creativity, code, and rhythm coexist. built from a collective dream, it connects young talents, restless minds, and bold ideas. through every project, the collective redefines what it means to create together, combining experimentation, emotion, and purpose. from digital labs to rehearsal rooms, every corner of <span class="highlight" style="--d:.1s;">STERRA</span> vibrates with imagination.
      <br><br>
      <span class="highlight" style="--d:.2s;">DEV</span> is the technological backbone of the collective. behind several local awards and digital innovations, the dev team gathers aspiring and emerging developers who are shaping their craft line by line. they explore new codes, build immersive experiences, and bridge creativity with technology, turning ideas into interactive realities.
      <br><br>
      <span class="highlight" style="--d:.3s;">RECORDS</span> is where the sound of <span class="highlight" style="--d:.35s;">STERRA</span> takes shape. led by the producer <span class="highlight" style="--d:.4s;">saintkarl</span> and the rappers <span class="highlight" style="--d:.45s;">jonvarer</span>, <span class="highlight" style="--d:.5s;">ytotk</span>, <span class="highlight" style="--d:.55s;">lil homer</span>, and <span class="highlight" style="--d:.6s;">young pi</span>, the sessions are built on collaboration and constant learning. between late night jams and studio experiments, they refine skills and transform ideas into records that carry feeling and intent.
      <br><br>
      <span class="highlight" style="--d:.65s;">SOUND</span> carries the pulse of raw energy. behind the garage band <span class="highlight" style="--d:.7s;">censored</span>, led by <span class="highlight" style="--d:.75s;">jonvarer</span>, this division explores the edges of noise and harmony. the mission is to test the limits of texture, dynamics, and emotion, bending expectations while searching for the perfect imperfection.
      <br><br>
      <span class="highlight" style="--d:.8s;">CREATIVE</span> is the heart of <span class="highlight" style="--d:.85s;">STERRA</span>. it unites photographers, videomakers, and game devs to give form to the collectiveâ€™s visual and conceptual identity. images, motion, and interactive worlds converge to tell stories, evoke emotions, and expand imagination. every frame, every pixel, every prototype feeds a shared vision that keeps evolving with each new collaboration.
      <br><br>
      together, these four pillars form the essence of <span class="highlight" style="--d:.9s;">STERRA</span>. it is not about perfection, but about process. it is not about fame, but about feeling. above all, it is about connection, the shared heartbeat of those who dare to create.
